# leanweb
Tool set for generating web components based web project.

## Installation

`npm install leanweb -g` as a global tool, or
`npm install leanweb -D` in the project as a dev dependency.

If leanweb is installed as a dev dependency of a project, you will need to run
`npx leanweb`, otherwise to just run `leanweb` if installed as global tool.

I don't see any reason leanweb should be installed as `npm install leanweb`.
